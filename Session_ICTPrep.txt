We will get 2 questions in our Java CC.
You can appear for the CC either through Eclipse IDE and tekstac plugin or directly through tekstac portal based on
your comfort.

Set<Character> set=new TreeSet<>();
String vowels="aeiou";
for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++){
	if(vowels.contains(Character.toString(str.charAt(i))){
		set.add(str.charAt(i));
	}
}
if(set.size()>=3)
	Syso(" ");


WAP to accept details of two mobiles. Compare both the mobiles
wrt color and price and print "similar" if same else "not similar".Override the equals() method [and toString() method]

class Mobile{
	String modelNo;
	String color;
	Double price;
	public boolean equals(Object obj){
		Mobile m=(Mobile)obj;	
		if(m.color.equals(this.color) &&
			m.price==this.price)
		return true;

		return false;
	}
}
Sample Input
Enter Model No
SM123
Enter color
white
Enter Price
10000.0
Enter Model No
SM123
Enter color
white
Enter Price
10000.0
Both mobiles are similar

You have the following classes:
class Student{
	String name;
	int rollNo;
}
Graduate which inherits Student and also has a specific
variable String stream.
PostGraduate which inherits Student and also has a specific
variable int papersPublished.
In the class Main add a static method print(Student student)
and is responsible to display the details....

Sample Input/Output
Enter RollNo
10112
Enter Name
Manish
1. Graduate 2. Post Graduate
2
Enter Papers Published
2
Details
Name: Manish
Roll:10112
Papers Published: 2

public static void print(Student student){
	//fill code here
	syso("Name:"+student.getName());
	if(student instanceof PostGraduate){
		PostGraduate pg=(PostGraduate) student;
		syso(pg.getPapersPublished());
	}
}

Create a class CustomException which inherits from Exception class and add the constructor from super class with String as an argument to pass the message. Accept an accountNo (int) from the user along with accountHolderName (String).
If the accountNo is not a 6 digit number throw an exception with message "invalid account no" and allow the user to renter
untill correct account no provided.

Sample Input/Output
Enter Account Holder Name
Aditi Saini
Enter Account No
156
Invalid accountNo
Enter Account No
15645
Invalid accountNo
Enter Account No
156478
Details
Account Holder Name: Aditi Saini
Account No: 156478

WAP to accept a list of names. Prepare a map as following
If the name is single worded, then first three chars in upper case will be the key and entire word will be the value.
If the name is of multiple words, then first letter of each word combined to upper case will be the key and entire name will be the value.

Sample Input
3
India
west indies
world health organization

Sample Output
{IND=India,WI=west indies,WHO=world health organization}

WAP to accept the details of a player, create a Player object
and save the record into the database. If inserted properly, 
display "Record inserted". [INSERT]

WAP to accept the palyer id and print the details of a player, after creating a Player object. [SELECT]

WAP to read from console and write into a file.
WAP to read from file and display on the console.

A demo silimar to ICT preparation:
It will be an end to end demo where you have to read a file,
perform certain computations and store the processed data into the table of the database.

Electric Bill System
consumers.csv
c1001,Jan-22,17423,17490
c1031,Jan-22,17573,15586
c1027,Jan-22,17423,17505

create table consumer
(
consumerid int primary key,
units int not null,
billmonth varchar(20) not null,
billable decimal(7,2) not null
);

Calculate the billable amount as per the below slab:
units <=50, 3.5 per unit
units >50 and <=100, 4.05 per unit
units >100 and <=250, 4.75 per unit
units >250, 5.00 per unit

Create the following classes:
DbUtil.java
database.properties
Consumer
ConsumerService | read the file create the List of consumers
Compute the bill amount and save the records in the database table.
Main | Create an instance of ConsumerService and invoke the methods accordingly.

Create a Java Project ICTPrep
Add the mysql-connector.jar file
Add the database.properties file
Add the DbUtil class in your project
